Multi-Threaded Web Server in Java :
This is a simple implementation of a multi-threaded web server in Java. The server can handle multiple client connections concurrently.

Features :
Multi-threaded: Utilizes Java's threading capabilities to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
Client-Server Communication: Demonstrates basic client-server communication over sockets.
Scalable: Designed to handle multiple client connections efficiently.
Usage :
Server
To run the server, execute the Server.java file. By default, the server listens on port 8010.


java Server.java
Client
To run the client, execute the Client.java file. The client connects to the server running on localhost on port 8010.


java Client.java

Run the server first.
Then, run the client(s).
