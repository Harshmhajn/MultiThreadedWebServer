Multi-Threaded Web Server in Java.
This is a simple implementation of a multi-threaded web server in Java. The server can handle multiple client connections concurrently.

Features
Multi-threaded: Utilizes Java's threading capabilities to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
Client-Server Communication: Demonstrates basic client-server communication over sockets.
Scalable: Designed to handle multiple client connections efficiently.
Usage
Server
To run the server, execute the Server.java file. By default, the server listens on port 8010.


java Server.java
Client
To run the client, execute the Client.java file. The client connects to the server running on localhost on port 8010.


java Client.java
Instructions
Run the server first.
Then, run the client(s).
The client sends a message to the server, and the server responds with "Hello From the Server".
The client(s) display the response from the server.
